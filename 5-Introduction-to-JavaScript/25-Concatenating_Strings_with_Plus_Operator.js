// + used with a string is called the concatenation operator
// you can build a new string out of other strings by concatenating them together
// concatenation does not add spaces between strings

// Example
var ourStr = "I come first. " + "I come second.";

// Only change code below this line

var myStr = "This is the start. " + "This is the end.";
